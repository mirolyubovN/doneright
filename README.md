This program is written in Python and was tested on Python 3.6. It uses some libraries that might need to be installed, such as: selenium, yaml
Unfortunately, I did not manage to adapt my program to be able to use xml format and think of a good use for exit codes.
To run the program, open terminal and type:
python testfile1 testfile2 ... testfilen
It will be producing output to the console and will exit with an exit code 0 or 1. 0 represents OK, 1 represents assertion error.
PS:I feel a bit ashamed submitting this as this program is not the one I can be proud of, but this was something completely new to me and I think I learned a lot.
